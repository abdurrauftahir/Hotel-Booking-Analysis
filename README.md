Data Analysis Project Steps
There are the following steps to analyze to Data Analytics project:
•	Create a Problem Statement.
•	Identify the data you want to analyze.
•	Explore and clean the data.
•	Analyze the data to get useful insights.
•	Present the data in terms of reports or dashboards using visualization.

About Dataset
This dataset contains 119390 observations for a City Hotel and a Resort Hotel. Each observation represents a hotel booking between the 1st of July 2015 and the 31st of August 2017, including bookings that effectively arrived and bookings that were canceled.
Since this is hotel real data, all data elements pertaining to the hotel or customer identification were deleted.
Four Columns, 'name', 'email', 'phone number', and 'credit card' have been artificially created and added to the dataset.

1) Reservation Status

The accompanying bar graph shows the percentage of reservations that are canceled and those that are not. It is obvious that there are still a significant number of reservations that have not been canceled. There are still 37% of clients who canceled their reservations, which has a significant impact on the hotels' earnings.

2) Reservation Status in different Hotels

 In comparison to resort hotels, city hotels have more bookings. It's possible that resort hotels are more expensive than those in cities.
 
3) Average Daily Rate in City and Resort Hotel

The line graph above shows that, on certain days, the average daily rate for a city hotel is less than that of a resort hotel, and on other days, it is even less. It goes without saying that weekends and holidays may see a rise in resort hotel rates.

4) Reservation Status per Month

We have developed the grouped bar graph to analyze the months with the highest and lowest reservation levels according to reservation status. As can be seen, both the number of confirmed reservations and the number of canceled reservations are the largest in the month of August. whereas January is the month with the most canceled reservations.


5) ADR for each Month

This bar graph demonstrates that cancellations are most common when prices are greatest and are least common when they are lowest. Therefore, the cost of the accommodation is solely responsible for the cancellation.

6) Top 10 Countries with Reservation Cancelled

Now, let's see which country has the highest reservation canceled. The top country is Portugal with the highest number of cancellations.

Let's check the area from where guests are visiting the hotels and making reservations. Is it coming from Direct or Groups, Online or Offline Travel Agents? Around 46% of the clients come from online travel agencies, whereas 27% come from groups. Only 4% of clients book hotels directly by visiting them and making reservations.

7) Average Daily Rate

As seen in the graph, reservations are canceled when the average daily rate is higher than when it is not canceled. It clearly proves all the above analysis, that the higher price leads to higher cancellations.







Suggestions

•	Cancellation rates rise as the price does. In order to prevent cancellations of reservations, hotels could work on their pricing strategies and try to lower the rates for specific hotels based on locations. They can also provide some discounts to the consumers.

•	As the ratio of the cancellation and not-cancellations of the resort hotel is higher in the resort hotel than in the city hotels. So, the hotels should provide a reasonable discount on the room prices on weekends or holidays.

•	In the month of January, hotels can start campaigns or marketing with a reasonable amount to increase their revenue as cancellation is the highest in this month.

•	They can also increase the quality of their hotels and their services mainly in Portugal to reduce the cancellation rate.
